## MLTRL Cards

Here we incude a template for MLTRL practitioners to copy/fork for use in their projects, teams, and organizations: [MLTRL Card](https://github.com/ai-infrastructure-alliance/mltrl/blob/main/mltrl_card.md).

Please see the MLTRL journal paper for example TRL Cards from several real-world use-cases.


## AI Ethics Guide

The MLTRL framework frequently calls on ethics policies to ensure safe and responsible technolgies.

Here we include a thorough AI ethics guide for all to use, and adapt to your domain as needed: (local link to ethics_checklist.md)

Note the recent develoment of community guidelines for AI publishing has resulted in a handful of industry-specific checklists. We list those that we know of here (and accept contributions from the community):
    - [MI_CLAIM (Minimum Information for CLinical AI Modeling)](https://github.com/beaunorgeot/MI-CLAIM)
    - [Checklist for Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging (CLAIM)](https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/ryai.2020200029)
